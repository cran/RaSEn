#' Affymetrix rat genome 230 2.0 array annotation data (chip rat2302). For this data set, 120 twelve-week old male rats were selected for tissue harvesting from the eyes and for microarray analysis. The expression of gene TRIM32 is set as the response and the 18975 probes that are expressed in the eye tissue are considered as the predictors.
